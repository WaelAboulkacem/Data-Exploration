# Industrial Data Analysis & KPI Reporting  
## High-Precision Manufacturing – Watchmaking Case Study 

## Project Overview
This project simulates an industrial data analysis scenario in a Swiss high-precision manufacturing environment within the watchmaking sector.  
The focus is on analyzing production and machine-level data to evaluate performance, quality, and operational efficiency.

## Objectives
- Clean and prepare raw industrial production data
- Analyze key manufacturing KPIs with a strong focus on quality and precision
- Identify performance bottlenecks related to machine downtime and defects
- Visualize KPIs to support operational decision-making
- Provide clear, written data-driven insights using industrial data storytelling

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- SQL for KPI aggregation and analysis
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and reporting

## Key KPIs Analyzed
- First Pass Yield (FPY)
- Defect Rate
- Machine Availability
- Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)
- Energy Consumption per Unit

## Project Structure
The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook and follows a structured approach:
1. Data understanding and cleaning  
2. KPI calculation and validation  
3. KPI visualization  
4. Interpretation of results and conclusions
