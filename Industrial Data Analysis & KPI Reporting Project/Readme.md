# Supply Chain Risk & Health Analysis
## Data Exploration • KPI Framework • Python Analysis • Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the supply chain performance of a beauty & makeup product company.
It focuses on identifying inventory risks, demand pressure, lead-time bottlenecks, and quality issues using a combination of Python and Power BI.
The goal is to simulate the typical work of a Supply Chain or Data Analyst Intern, including:

## Objectives
- Data cleaning and exploration
- KPI definition and calculation
- Risk assessment
- Dashboard creation
- Business reporting

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data visualization with Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and reporting

## Key KPIs Analyzed
- First Pass Yield (FPY)
- Defect Rate
- Machine Availability
- Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)
- Energy Consumption per Unit

## Project Structure

##### The dataset, it contains 100 SKUs across multiple supply-chain dimensions, including:
Inventory levels
Sales and demand
Supplier information
Shipping modes and costs ...

##### The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook and follows a structured approach:
1. data_exploration.ipynb: 
Dataset inspection
Missing value checks
Outlier detection

2. kpi_definitions.md
Description of all KPIs
Business interpretation
Risk thresholds
Rationale for each KPI

3. kpi_calculation.ipynb
Calculation of all KPIs using Python
Includes:
Stock Coverage Ratio
Demand Pressure Index
Total Lead Time
Manufacturing Lead Time Share
Cost performance KPIs
Quality exposure metrics
Final KPI dataset exported for Power BI

##### Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI Dashboard visualizes the main supply chain risk areas:
Inventory and Demand ; Lead Time ; Quality and Cost
